**Description:** Income inequality - when income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population - is a growing problem in developing nations across the world. With the rapid rise of AI and worker automation, this problem could continue to grow if steps are not taken to address the issue. This solution can potentially reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of monitoring key population indicators such as income level in between census years. This information will help policymakers to better manage and avoid income inequality globally.

**Problem Statement:** The target feature is **income_above_limit** which is a binary-class variable. The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns above or below a certain amount. Your metric for evaluation will be **f1-score**.
